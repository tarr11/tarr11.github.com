I have deactivated my Twitter for the obvious reasons.  It's mostly drama now and it wastes a lot of my time.  

I have no interest in Mastodon at this point.  I suppose LinkedIn is the only public social network I am still on. 

If you are interested in following me, follow my [RSS feed](/atom.xml) here like it's 1999.  

Also - please send me an email and say hi!  I would love to hear from you!

My email address is on my [contact page](/contact.html).
